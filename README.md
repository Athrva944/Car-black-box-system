# Car Black Box System

## Introduction
The Car Black Box System is a real-time data recording and storage solution designed to enhance vehicle safety by analyzing critical data related to vehicle performance and incidents. This system captures and logs information such as vehicle speed, acceleration, braking, and environmental data, which can be used for accident analysis and performance evaluation.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Logging**: Continuously records key vehicle parameters like speed, acceleration, and environmental data.
- **Event Detection and Storage**: Automatically saves critical data during incidents for detailed analysis.
- **Communication Protocols**: Supports UART, I2C, SPI, and CAN for seamless sensor integration.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Uses pointers and file operations for optimized storage.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Real-time alerts for predefined conditions (e.g., high temperature or rapid deceleration).

## How It Works

### Data Collection
1. **Sensors Integration**:
   - Monitors parameters using speed, acceleration, temperature, and impact sensors.
   - Interfaces with hardware through UART, I2C, SPI, and CAN communication protocols.
2. **Data Logging**:
   - Processes and stores data with timestamps for chronological analysis.
3. **Event Triggers**:
   - Detects events like sudden braking or collisions and stores high-priority data segments.

### Data Analysis
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays vehicle parameters on a user interface.
- **Incident Analysis**: Reconstructs recorded data to understand the sequence of events.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Provides insights into driving behavior and vehicle health.

## Requirements
### Hardware
- Microcontroller with real-time capabilities.
- Sensors for speed, acceleration, temperature, and impact detection.
- Storage module (e.g., SD card or EEPROM).

### Software
- Embedded C programming environment.
- GCC for firmware compilation.
- Debugging tools for hardware-software integration.

### Communication Protocols
- UART, I2C, SPI, CAN.

## Installation and Usage
